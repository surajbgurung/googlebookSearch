### Application Use

The app is a single page React Application. The user lands on a simple search page, with base level instructions, and a search bar with a submit button. The user enters in book info they wish to search for and utilizing the Google Books API, we query the Google Books app for info, and render the results on the screen for the user to peruse. 
The results also have a save button in them, allowing the user to save books they are interested in, which are saved to the MongoDB for retrieval. By using the navigation bar, the user can move to the Saved page, which displays all saved books from the database. They have an option to delete books from the database from this page.
